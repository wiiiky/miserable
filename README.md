Shadowsocks
===================

Shadowsocks is a fast tunnel proxy that was developed by clowwindy at first.

For well-known reasons, clowwindy has to give up shadowsocks.

I have used shadowsocks instead of VPN for nearly 7 months to bypass the [Great Fire Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall). And I really like it.

Then I fork it and try to continue to develop it.


Refer to the original README written by clowwindy for more details about shadowsocks.
